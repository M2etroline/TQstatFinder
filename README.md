# TQstatFinder
This project, is a tool that uses Data scraped from the site https://www.tq-db.net/en/.
It's expected to use it in combination, in order to check the Items you are interested in.
In this programme you can search a specific stat using keywords.

Im a fan of Glass Canon build and was thinking of making something alike for a while.

In order to launch the programme you need to download the realase.
After extracting the files, navigate to dist, in there you will find a file called GUI.exe.
Launch the programme using that file.

###### Update!

As of right now, the programe is detected by some Antiviruses as a threat. The detection is a false-positive as the programme is not malicious. Some antivirus software doesn't have all virus definitions updated. The problem lies with the library that converts the .py file to an .exe, simmilar problem is discussed here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg
To assure security, download python versions 3.6 and above from the official website: https://www.python.org and launch the GUI.py located in the folder.
Sorry for the inconvenience, I was not aware of this problem, as my Antivirus didn't detect anything.
